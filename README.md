# Real_Estate on the Flow Blockchain 

Create a platform for selling and buying of physical Real Estate assets through the use of dynamic NFTâ€™s which would upgrade based upon the property.

 This would enable Purchasing of Property in the form of NFTs using credit cards, and completely abstracting away the presence of the underlying blockchain.
 
Possible Advantages 
 
Increased Transparency: Using blockchain technology can increase transparency and reduce the likelihood of fraud or disputes. This is because all the transactions and ownership details would be stored on a decentralized ledger, making it easier to verify the authenticity of the asset and its ownership.

Liquidity: NFTs can make it easier to buy and sell real estate assets because they can be fractionalized, meaning that they can be broken down into smaller portions, allowing more people to invest in them. This could potentially make real estate investment more accessible to a wider range of investors.

Speed: Traditional real estate transactions can be slow and require a lot of paperwork. Using NFTs on the blockchain could speed up the process by making it easier to transfer ownership of the asset.

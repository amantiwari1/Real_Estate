Create a platform for selling and buying of physical Real Estate assets through the use of dynamic NFT’s which would upgrade based upon the property.

 This would enable Purchasing of Property in the form of NFTs using credit cards, and completely abstracting away the presence of the underlying blockchain.

# Features

*> Built on Flow

We chose Flow as the  blockchain to build because of their track record of enabling great Web3 user experiences, low fees and commitment to user safety. 



Flow is also one of the greenest blockchains. Minting an NFT on Flow produces less carbon than posting on Instagram!

## Possible Advantages 
 
• Increased Transparency: Using blockchain technology can increase transparency and reduce the likelihood of fraud or disputes. This is because all the transactions and ownership details would be stored on a decentralized ledger, making it easier to verify the authenticity of the asset and its ownership.

• Liquidity: NFTs can make it easier to buy and sell real estate assets because they can be fractionalized, meaning that they can be broken down into smaller portions, allowing more people to invest in them. This could potentially make real estate investment more accessible to a wider range of investors.

• Speed: Traditional real estate transactions can be slow and require a lot of paperwork. Using NFTs on the blockchain could speed up the process by making it easier to transfer ownership of the asset.

## When selecting real estate properties to represent as NFTs, we are considering the following factors:

• Location: Properties in prime locations with high demand are more likely to attract buyers, so it's a good idea to choose properties that are in popular areas.

• Type of Property: Different types of properties have varying demand and appeal. For instance, residential properties such as apartments or houses, commercial properties like offices, retail shops, or industrial warehouses, or even land.

• Condition: The condition of the property is also an essential factor to consider. A property that is in good condition and has been well-maintained is likely to have a higher value.

° Historical Significance: Properties that have historical or cultural significance might have more value and could potentially attract a broader audience.

° Market Value: The market value of the property is an important factor to consider when selecting properties to represent as NFTs. The value of the property should be high enough to make it an attractive investment for buyers.
